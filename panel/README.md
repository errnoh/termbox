termbox/panel
=============

Helper library for [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) to split screen into panels 

Documentation at http://godoc.org/github.com/errnoh/termbox/panel

NOTES
-----

**API is not frozen!**
The library wasn't finished before I had to move on to another project and there are some design choices that I dislike.
Borders will probably be moved to separate library at some point and there are most likely some bugs.
